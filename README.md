# GeoStatsBase.jl

[![][build-img]][build-url] [![][codecov-img]][codecov-url]

This package contains problem and solution specifications, as well
as development tools for the [GeoStats.jl](https://github.com/juliohm/GeoStats.jl)
framework. It is not intended to be used as a standalone package,
and only exists to make it possible for researchers to write their
own solvers independently of the main project, and its development
cycle. A quick overview of the problems defined in the package is
provided in the GeoStats.jl documentation.
